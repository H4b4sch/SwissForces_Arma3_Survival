 * This section uses a numeric quantification of capacity and cost of the objets.

 * The capacity doesn't represent a real volume or weight, but a choice made for gameplay.
 * 
 * Note : the priority of a declaration of cost/capacity to another one corresponds to the inverse order in the tables.
 *   It means that the most generic classes should be listed before the less generic classes.
 *   For example : the "Truck_F" class is a child of the "Car_F" class (see http://madbull.arma.free.fr/A3_stable_1.20.124746_CfgVehicles_tree.html).
 *   If "Car_F" is declared before "Truck_F" with a capacity of 40, and "Truck_F" is declared after with a capacity of 140,
 *   Then all the child classes of "Truck_F" will have a capacity of 140.
 *   And all the derived classes of "Car_F", not in "Truck_F", will have a capacity of 40.
