# Information
This is a small script that was extracted from the co36-resistance-altis Mission to provide
functionality for doing field repairs on vehicles to make them operable again. This
is very useful, when your car is crashed but have no repair truck near it.

To Actiate the Script, please add the following command to the init.sql file:

```
[] execVM "SAF_Field_Repair\Field_Repair.sqf";
```
